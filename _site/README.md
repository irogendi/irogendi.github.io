Just a simple, minimalist portfolio/blog site built using Jekyll. 
No frameworks were used (oh god it sucked) but jQuery was nessecary for some small lightbox script that the site uses.
Everything else is patchwork from stuff I liked and decided to implement in my own noob-ish and, probably, very unorthodox way.

Look around if you fancy. 
I don't think there's much to see from this side. Just visit the site directly!
